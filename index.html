            <p>
            This application let's you save your CS2 settings into .cfg files, 
            including popular settings and binds that aren't available in the game's menu but are often used by pros. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was designed using <strong>Unity</strong> and every command from the game was researched and implemented, so you can easily create your own custom configs.

            <h2>The Problem with Custom Keybinds and Layouts</h2>
            <p>
                The biggest issue when creating custom keybinds in CS2 isn’t with the standard keybindings found in the game’s settings menu — those work fine regardless of your keyboard layout.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem appears when you try to bind actions that are <strong>only available via the console</strong>, such as <code>noclip</code>, <code>toggle r_fullscreen_gamma [values]</code> or any other advanced binds.
            </p>
            <p>
                On <strong>non-US keyboard layouts</strong> (let's use Spanish or Portuguese as an example), some keys — like <code>ç</code> — simply aren’t recognized by the console. For example, running <code>bind ç noclip</code> 
                will result in an error because <code>ç</code> is not a valid key name according to CS2. <img src="images/console.jpg" alt="Descripción de la imagen">

            </p>
            <p>
                You might think: “I’ll just find the US equivalent.” But here’s the catch: <strong>ISO keyboards (used in most of Europe) have one more key than ANSI (US) layouts</strong>, and the <strong>Enter key is shaped differently</strong>, which causes several keys to be placed differently. 
                For example, the <code>ç</code> key doesn’t exist on a US layout, so it has no direct counterpart. This makes it impossible to bind unless you can guess the correct, layout-dependent key name — which varies between systems.
                <img src="images/difference-spanish-english.jpg" alt="Difference between Spanish and English layouts">
            </p>
            <p>
                This makes creating reliable custom configs a nightmare for anyone not using a US keyboard, and this was the main motivation behind creating this application.

                <h3>Keyboard Layout Independent</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest advantages is that this app works with <strong>any keyboard physical and logical layout</strong>. Instead of using layout-specific key names, it uses
                    <a class="link" href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_Scancode" target="_blank">SDL scancodes</a>, these codes represent the physical key of every keyboard, and they are used in Counter-Strike 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This ensures your config works the same on <strong>QWERTY</strong>, <strong>AZERTY</strong>, <strong>DVORAK</strong>, and others — no more broken keybinds.
                </p>
                <p> You can even <strong>test your keyboard</strong> using the application, just select ISO/ANSI, press a key, and it will turn blue!</p>

                <h3>Familiar layout & easy to use</h3>
                <p>
                    The app's interface replicates the in-game settings menu.
                    You can easily navigate through the different sections and categories, just like in CS2.
                    In the binds section you can see your "logical" keybinds with the US layout equivalent,
                    and also an information panel that shows the command and its description.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Set your binds</strong> and <strong>click the save button</strong>. (There's an option to add an <strong>"unbindall"</strong> at the beginning)
                    <li>The application will ask for a folder to export the <strong>binds.cfg</strong> file.</li>
                    <li>Do the same with the settings to generate the <strong>settings.cfg</strong> file.</li>
                </ol>

                    <!--This app automates the creation of `.cfg` files for CS2, making it easy to save, export, and reuse your settings. -->
                    Each command/bind is placed inside a category. Perfect for sharing configs or switching between PCs. <image src="images/organized-binds.jpg"></image>

                <p>
                    It includes advanced commands and binds commonly used by professional players — but not available in CS2 menus — such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multibinds for the same key (example: <code>bind "scancode95" "buy molotov; buy incgrenade"</code>)</li>
                    <li>Multikeys for the same bind (example: <code>bind "scancode44" "+jump"; bind "MWHEELDOWN" "+jump"</code>)</li>
                    <li>Buy binds</li>
                    <li>Sound and HUD toggle binds</li>
                    <li>Bot commands and toggle binds</li>
                    <li><code>say</code> binds</li>
                    <li><code>sv_cheats</code> related commands to practice</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Automatic updates</h3>
                <p>
                    The application fetches all <a href="https://buquerindev.github.io/CS2BindGeneratorUnity/appdata/commands.json" target="_blank">settings</a> 
                    and <a href="https://buquerindev.github.io/CS2BindGeneratorUnity/appdata/binds.json" target="_blank">binds</a> from remote JSON files. 
                    These are loaded and instantiated dynamically, which means new features or game updates can be integrated without requiring the user to download a new version. 
                    Updates only become necessary in case of major structural changes or critical bug fixes.

            <p>
                The application is available for <strong>Windows only</strong>.
                Please note that it is <strong>not digitally signed</strong>, so Windows may show a “Windows protected your PC” warning when you try to run it.
                This happens because unsigned apps are treated as unverified by default.

                However, the application is <strong>fully open-source</strong>, and you can inspect or compile the code yourself.
                This transparency acts as a security guarantee for users who are cautious about running third-party software.
